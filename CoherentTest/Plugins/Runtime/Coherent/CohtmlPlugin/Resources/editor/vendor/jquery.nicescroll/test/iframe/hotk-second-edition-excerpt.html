some of you reading this it may seem as though I am describing a

<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>In the early autumn of 2608, in
the 11th year of his reign, Crown Emperor Adam Lorenzo III gathered
together an assembly of his highest aides for what was to become a
historic moment in the Mitikas Empire's history. With the delegates
and representatives seated and listening, and his words being
broadcast across a great number of worlds for his subjects to hear,
he delivered the news that many had long expected. He was to grant
independent status to two of the empire's star systems.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>The decision had long been
rumoured, but today it had been made fact, and his words were greeted
with rapturous applause and jubilation throughout many a city street.
The star systems in question, Tigris and Sampi-Persei VII, were part
of a number that had been swallowed up during the early days of the
empire's expansion; their absorption into the swelling Imperial
regime either a result of military force, political pressure, or
other questionable coercions. None had joined willingly. For many
years, the peoples of these worlds had campaigned for freedom and
independence. Not because the empire was a cruel and dangerous state
– it was far from these things – but because of the desire to
return to being the republics they once had been, and for the chance
to shape their own futures.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>And today, their wishes had been
granted.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>The celebrations began
immediately, with the citizens of Tigris and Sampi-Persei VII dancing
and singing in the streets, waving flags and crying tears of joy.
Even those not directly affected by the move wore great smiles, for
this would only make the emperor more popular and show galactic
neighbours, the existing Independent worlds and nations, and the
Confederacy, that they were a powerful, yet permissive and tolerant
society.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>But there were those who didn't
agree with the emperor, their faces dour as they sat before him. As
the applause rang and the cameras flashed, a number of nay-sayers
throughout the conference hall began voicing their dissatisfaction.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>Having opposed what they saw as
the beginnings of devolution, the Imperial Senate were unhappy with
the day's decision, and the Senior Magistrate, Maximilian
Tyler-Brett, rose to confront the emperor over it. Broadcasting his
feelings directly after Lorenzo's speech, he accused the emperor of
undermining the great nation's foundations, preparing to pull the rug
out from under its feet. This move, he said, wouldn't make them
appear stronger and more liberal to their enemies, but quite the
opposite. It would make them appear foolish and weak. It was the
Senate's position that the emperor was preparing to dismantle, brick
by brick, the empire for which his predecessors had spilt blood,
sweat and tears to build.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>There were mumbles and murmurs of
agreement, though they weren't as strong as the cheers and
celebrations that had preceded them.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>But Emperor Adam was untroubled
by the Senate's opposition, and very sedately called for calm.
Nonsense, he smiled, the Senate's fears were both overblown and
misplaced. There was nothing to worry about, no cause for alarm. He
had heard such objections since the very first day he had entertained
the delegates of the worlds he was about to set free. He knew he
could not please everybody, he could only ever make so many people
happy. Besides, he reassured the Senate, the peoples he was to set
free had already agreed to work side by side with the empire,
trading, researching and working exclusively with them, indefinitely.
The only change was that they would no longer be governed by his
rule, no longer subject to Imperial laws and statutes. Other than
that, they remained as loyal as ever.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>The Senior Magistrate grumbled
his further objections, but the emperor waved away his concerns. The
declaration was signed, hands were shaken and that afternoon two star
systems were set free; two new nations were born.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>Tyler-Brett missed all of it,
turning his back on the further proceedings. “We'll never forgive
this,” he said, as he walked out.</I></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>A few days later, a messenger
arrived at the palace, bearing bad tidings. The Senate had abandoned
the Forum and taken leave of Kethlan. Lead by the Senior Magistrate,
they had departed for and settled within Krasst, a star system in the
southern quarter of Mitikas. This, they said they had done, in
opposition to the emperor.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>Lorenzo was stunned by the news
and immediately sent an envoy to Hyanik, the planet where the Senate
had reconvened the Forum, to bid them return. The messenger returned
barely a day later, with the news that the call had been rejected.
The emperor then sent out another envoy, this time demanding their
return, by express order of the Crown Emperor of the Mitikas Empire.
The envoy was never seen nor heard from again.</I></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>A month passed, when the emperor
was woken one night by terrible news. It seemed that Tigris, the star
system he had freed not five weeks earlier, had been attacked, an act
for which the Senate claimed full responsibility. The messenger
showed him imagery of colonies that had suffered terrible orbital
bombardments, reducing many to nothing but a smouldering memory.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>Of those that had survived, so
terrible was the attack that the smoke and flames that ravaged the
towns and cities were visible from space. Racked by grief, the
emperor ordered aid to be sent immediately, though he discovered some
time later that there had been few survivors.</I></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>Weeks passed, but still the
Senate refused to meet or entertain the emperor, or any of his
delegates, despite Lorenzo's repeated attempts to initiate dialogue.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>Then the day came when they made
an attempt on his life.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>One evening, while Lorenzo was at
dinner, one of the serving staff removed the cover of a silver
platter he had set down before the emperor, only to snatch up a
dagger that had been hidden there. The emperor succeeded in avoiding
the slash that had been intended for his throat, deflecting a second
with a scalding hot plate. The assassin was brought down by Lorenzo's
bodyguards, before he was able to try again.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>Following the incident, Margaret,
the emperor's wife, closest friend and mother of his three sons,
implored him to take direct action against the Senate. It was clearly
the only language they would understand, she said.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>Lorenzo refused. Men should solve
their problems with words, not bombs. And against all advice, the
emperor chose to travel to Krasst for a face-to-face dialogue with
the tenacious Tyler-Brett and the fifty-four other members of the
Senate.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>A few days after he intended to
make the journey, the emperor awoke with little memory of the time
before. He found himself in a hospital bed, his arm in a sling, his
chest and face bandaged. He was told how a bomb had been discovered
on his shuttle, and that his team had only just managed to evacuate
him before it had gone off. Even so, he had suffered life-threatening
injuries.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
“<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>Where is my wife? Where is
Maggie?” Lorenzo asked, for she had offered to accompany him to his
meeting with the Senate. The doctor's eyes turned to the floor and he
spoke the sad news – she hadn't made it. She had already been
settled onboard the shuttle when the threat had been discovered.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>The emperor wept. Had he listened
to his wife, she would still be alive today. He would listen to her
now. Violence truly was the only language that the Senate understood.
And so, in his rage and despair, he summoned Jason Zackaria, the
Fleet Admiral of the Imperial Naval Forces. His orders were simple –
destroy the Senate. Wipe them out.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>The admiral spoke his
understanding, and in the days and weeks that followed, the emperor
viewed reports, videos and imagery of the result of his orders. The
Senate's forces and followers were overwhelmed. Against the full
might of the Imperial navy, they stood little chance. They were being
crushed.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>But that saddened the emperor. He
couldn't wipe them out completely, it wasn't within his nature.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>It was therefore as the INF
surrounded Hyanik that the emperor called a ceasefire, before once
again sending an envoy to meet the Senate. It seemed that his wife
had been right, for this time they accepted the envoy, and conceded
to the emperor's demands that they relent and surrender to his rule.
The battle ended, the INF withdrew, and work began rebuilding the
colonies of Tigris.</I></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>Some months later, as the emperor
was finalizing details to grant independence to more of the empire's
star systems, reports flooded in that the Senate had risen once again
and had resumed committing acts of terror.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
“<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>How could this be?” the
emperor asked. The Senate and their followers had been defeated, they
had repented and surrendered. Tyler-Brett had been tried and
incarcerated for his many acts of treason. How was it that they could
be on the move once again?</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>At first, Lorenzo believed this
to be the work of dissidents, nothing more than a splinter group. He
soon discovered otherwise. A number of the empire's core star systems
had been attacked, and hit hard. Totally sacked, this wasn't the work
of a minor faction.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>And as he watched the video feeds
of the plights of the affected systems, a fear gripped him. This
wasn't the Senate that he remembered, this was something else. Across
battlefields he saw soldiers, clad in black suits and black helmets,
with eyes that shone ruby-red in the dark, racing forward and
attacking with inhuman speed, efficiency and ferocity. Flags and
standards billowed over their heads, depicting a symbol of the like
he had never seen before – the outline of a man clutching a spear,
a long sash issuing from the tip and curling around his body.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>At that moment, as he viewed
footage of the battles on the ground, in the skies and in space, he
knew something was very wrong. He again summoned Fleet Admiral Jason
Zackaria and Commodore Julian Rissard, ordering them to confront
these mysterious adversaries and drive them back from where they had
come, before they sacked the whole imperium.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><I>But for all their efforts,
Zackaria and Rissard could not. The relentless spread of the
black-clad soldiers continued, growing stronger with each passing
day. Petty squabbles throughout the empire were forgotten, as the
nation drew together to fight the menace that threatened its
existence. But the days soon turned to weeks; the weeks, months; and
the months, years; and in all that time, the emperor and his forces
were powerless to prevent the advancement of the Enemy who left
nothing but death and destruction behind them.</I></FONT></P>

that day in the courtroom. The dream he had experienced two weeks ago
hadn't been wholly accurate – more a muddled amalgamation of the
events of that day, combined with his own feelings of guilt. Twelve
years at a penal colony was what the Judge Advocate had really
sentenced him to. Some had called it too lenient; some, too harsh.
Simon felt it was fair. The reaction of his victim's families had
been an invention of his own imagination. They weren't aware of what
had really happened, of how he had actually been driven to a
starport, handed a bag of his personal possessions and told to pick
out a destination for which he would spend the next six months on
suspension. Commodore Elliott Parks had been there to see him off,
but had offered little in the way of an explanation. No one had told
the Castros or the Pitts. For all they knew, he was behind bars on
some desolate waste of a planet, counting down the months and years
until the day he would be free. Eleven years, seven months.</FONT></FONT></P>

The floors were wooden, and a number of bookcases, stacked high with
numerous novels, hardback reference manuals and photo albums, gave
off an air of maturity. Colourful paintings and decorative plates
hung on the walls and occupied other shelves, side-by-side with
ornamental statues. A couple of candelabra-styled lights hung down
from the ceiling. A clock, set upon the mantelpiece of the hearth,
ticked quietly away.</FONT></FONT></P>

greater number of systems, all snuggled together like fish that had
been dragged up in a net. Then there were the Independent worlds and
states, running between the two huge nations like a gulf or a river,
keeping them apart and acting as a buffer of sorts. Here and there
throughout the declared Independent space, star systems were marked
